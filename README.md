# API Gateway Federator (AGF) Specification

This repository contains classes and interfaces which can be used for implementing an API Gateway Federator, a software for abstracting the use of API Gateway managers and avoiding vendor lock-in.

This project uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/index.html) as dependency manager.

## UML Documentation

[Class diagrams](docs/README.md)

Class diagrams were generated by [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com). This tool requires, besides Java, [Graphviz](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz), which can be installed in Debian with `sudo apt install graphviz`.

The process of generating the diagrams is like this:

1. Download PlantUML from https://plantuml.com/download to the project root. The `.gitignore` file is set to ignore `.jar` files in the project root.

2. Rename the downloaded file to `plantuml.jar`.

3. Install [GenUML](https://github.com/samuller/genuml):

```shell
pip install genuml
```

4. Run [generatedocs.php](generatedocs.php) script:

```shell
php generatedocs.php
```

This script makes the following steps:

1. It create a .puml file for each Java class or interface found in the  `org.vendorunlockingpatterns`.

2. It gathers the classes of a same package into a same .puml file and deletes the individual files.

3. It generates images of the class diagrams from the .puml files.

4. It recreates docs/README.md file with the links to the generated images.

## Javadoc

[Javadoc site](./impl/target/site/apidocs/index.html)

For generating Javadoc HTML documentation, run the following command at `impl` directory:

```shell
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```

## Deployment

You must change `version` tag in [POM file](impl/pom.xml) before to deploy.

```shell
mvn clean install javadoc:jar source:jar deploy
```
